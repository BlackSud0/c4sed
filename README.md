# C4SED
C4SED is a simple web-based platform, providing analysis and design of steel elements. The degree of integration, simplicity of input, and speed of design make c4sed the ideal platform for common steel elements calculations and reports.

# Analysis and design Features?
Web-based Calculations and Reports.  
Supports uniformly Distributed, & Point Loads.  
Fully Interactive Analysis with results updating as you edit.  
Design based on BS 5950 standards.  

# Supported Elements?  
I-Sections eg UB "Simply supported, Cantilevers" , UC.  
Angles.  
Connections.  

# Methodology
We continuously research and implement the most modern ways of steel design based on high-level, integrated numerical analysis. We are also seriously dealing with design issues outside of the standard methods in order to offer practical solutions for the engineers in these complex fields as well.

# Technology
We built a highly automated calculation system with modularity and flexibility in its focus. With its help, as an engineer, you can shortcut your design process, so you can focus on planning great buildings. Seeing the changes in the software and hardware used in different engineering fields, we are committed to reconstructing the outdated workflow of structural engineering, with the support of the newest on-premise and cloud-based solutions.

# Community
We want to support a new generation of civil engineers community where the governing working rules are collaboration and knowledge sharing. Our dream is to connect demands and solutions, engineers and developers, models and calculations from all over the world to help a truly efficient design workflow utilizing the power of the engineering community.

# Security Vulnerabilities
